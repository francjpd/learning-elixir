The very first project created by following the [official guide](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html#our-first-project) to learn and understand mix, the build tool that provides tasks such as create, compile, test & manage dependencies.

It's like if you combined NPM and your favorite web framework (Vue, React, Angular). Basically a npm with steroids.     

<small> GREAT!!, i can now create projects following a basic structure!</small>

The reason i took this book was to refresh & reinforce my knowledge about Functional programming.

*Update*: After reading a few pages (up to 40ish out of 190), i got bored, i guess i need a more advanced book. My next book would be Functional Web Development with Elixir, OTP, and Phoenix

This is the right book if you want to have a solid foundation before trying out other libraries / frameworks from Elixir.

Since i've been into the frontend world for last 7 years or so, it makes sense to me to learn about Phoenix.
