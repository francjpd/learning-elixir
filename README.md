The very first project created by following the [official guide](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html#our-first-project) to learn and understand mix, the build tool that provides tasks such as create, compile, test & manage dependencies.

It's like if you combined NPM and your favorite web framework (Vue, React, Angular). Basically a npm with steroids.
