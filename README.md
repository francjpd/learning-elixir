# Learning elixir from a frontend point of view
This project will give you a learning path with feedback from a Frontend developer's point of view.

Also, the readme will contain my brief resume from each project. 

## kv

The very first project created by following the [official guide](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html#our-first-project) to learn and understand mix, the build tool that provides tasks such as create, compile, test & manage dependencies.

It's like if you combined NPM and your favorite web framework (Vue, React, Angular). Basically a npm with steroids. 

> GREAT!!, i can now create projects following a basic structure!
